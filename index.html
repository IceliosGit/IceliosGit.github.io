                    American Beaver (Castor canadensis): Larger and more industrious, the American beaver excels at building massive dams and 
                    altering the environment. Their ability to create expansive wetlands gives you more opportunities for growth, 
                    but requires more resources and planning.

                    European Beaver (Castor fiber): Smaller but more efficient, the European beaver focuses on precision and smaller-scale dams. 
                    Their ability to adapt to various environments makes them versatile, with a more balanced resource management approach.
